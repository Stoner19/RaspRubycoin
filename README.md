# RaspRubycoin

## Prerequisites

### Node.JS

#### On the rPi
To install Node.JS on the Raspberry Pi run the following commands.

Download a prebuilt ARM version of node.js by running this command:

`wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.28/node-v0.10.28-linux-arm-pi.tar.gz`

then run:

`cd /usr/local && sudo tar --strip-components 1 -xzf ~/node-v0.10.28-linux-arm-pi.tar.gz`

You will likely be prompted for a password because of sudo.

#### On Linux (ubuntu 14.04)

Note: 15.04 seems to be pretty new and nodejs is not built for it yet. If you get node installed it'll work otherwise stick to 14.04.

* Add the PPA
`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js`

* Update download servers
`sudo apt-get update`

* Install Node.js
`sudo apt-get install nodejs`

* Install Python Software Properties (a pre-requisite)
`sudo apt-get install python-software-properties`

* Install SQLite
`sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev`

* Install Git
`sudo apt-get install git`
* Install Nodemon (if you are making changes, it'll make it easier with nodemon)
`sudo npm install nodemon -g`

* Install Mocha (for running the tests)
`sudo npm install mocha -g`

* Install Git
`sudo apt-get install git`

## Setup

Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/tvl83/RaspPaycoin <directory>`.
The `<directory>` is optional if you do not want the default folder name of `RaspPaycoin`.

In the root directory of the project run `npm install` and `sudo npm install bower -g`. Let everything install, then `cd public` and run `bower install`.

## Config 

Rename the `/config/config.changeme.json` to `config.json` with `mv config.changeme.json config.json`
 
Within the `config.json` change the rpcuser, rpcpassword, and rpcport to what ever is set in your `paycoin.conf`.

The `paycoin.conf` that is on the raspberryPi is configured with the default settings so you wont have to do anything. On any other system you need to set it to the correct parameters.

## Figure Out The rPi IP Address

There are a couple ways to figure this out. The most straight forward way is to use your router and look at connected devices and get the IP from that. The device name is `paycoind`. 

If you have an iPhone or Android phone you can download a free program called `FING` which detects all the detected devices on your wifi connection.

Using `FING` it'll be `paycoind` device. 

## Run the server

From the root directory run `npm start`

When started, you may point your browser to `localhost:3000`

If you are using nodemon run `nodemon --ignore public/`
 
Nodemon will detect changes and automatically restart node when changes are detected.

On the rPi and Ubuntu you can figure out your local IP address by running `ifconfig`. It will look like this

I highlighted the part that is your local IP.
